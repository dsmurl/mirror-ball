# Frontend — deploy (via GitHub Actions)

The site is built with Vite and uploaded to the S3 bucket under the `site/` prefix. CloudFront serves the site and images.

## What the workflow does (planned)
1. Build the frontend in `apps/frontend/`.
2. Sync `dist/` to `s3://<bucket>/site/` (delete removed files).
3. Optionally create a CloudFront invalidation for `/*`.

## Required outputs
From Pulumi (in `apps/infra/`):
- `cloudFrontDomainName`
- `bucketName`
